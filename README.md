In today's business world, where every additional percent of efficiency gain can be a competitive advantage, small businesses and e-commerce retailers have no choice but to adopt machine learning and AI across the full spectrum of their business functions.  
Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to invest millions to incorporate machine learning into your business. You can efficiently leverage its power  by starting on a rather granular scale, using pre-built modules, then gradually extending your AI library - given you have the right data mining architecture.
As W. Edwards Deming said, “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”
 - Synthetic data generation, agent-based simulators, forecasting, and asset management using machine learning; with
 - Quantitative funds, multinational investment banks, financial market authorities, the office of national statistics, and other british government departments.
