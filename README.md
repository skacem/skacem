From the world of programming to the vibrant art scene of DR. Congo, I’ve navigated diverse paths but remain deeply rooted in technology. With a diploma in Electrical Engineering and an MBA in General Management,  I now dedicate my time to promoting African artists through [kitokongo.art](https://kitokongo.art) and curating unique artworks for sale on [kitokongo.store](https://kitokongo.store). Yet, the engineer in me never rests —I'm still captivated by the ever-evolving landscapes of AI, programming, and cutting-edge technology.

- 🌍 Connecting Cultures: Bridging the gap between art and technology by elevating African art on a global scale.
- 🤖 Tech at Heart: Exploring AI, data analysis, and digital transformation.
- 🖼️ Visual Storytelling: Crafting narratives through data and art.
- 🌱 Lifelong Learner: Always keen to learn new languages and tools —Rust, Go, and FastAPI  are on my radar.
- 💬 Let's Chat: Whether it's about the fusion of art and tech, AI's role in business, or anything that sparks creativity, I'm here for it!

In today's business world, where every additional percent of efficiency gain can be a competitive advantage, small businesses and e-commerce retailers have no choice but to adopt machine learning and AI across the full spectrum of their business functions.  
Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to invest millions to incorporate machine learning into your business. You can efficiently leverage its power  by starting on a rather granular scale, using pre-built modules, then gradually extending your AI library - given you have the right data mining architecture.
As W. Edwards Deming said, “Without data, you’re just another person with an opinion.”
 - Synthetic data generation, agent-based simulators, forecasting, and asset management using machine learning; with
 - Quantitative funds, multinational investment banks, financial market authorities, the office of national statistics, and other british government departments.
